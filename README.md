# Computer Vision - Rock, Paper Scissors (RPS)

> Rock, paper, scissors is a classic game in which a player decides to choose rock, paper or scissors at the time of reveal - the rock beats scissors, paper beats rock and scissors beats paper. 

This will be an implementation of the RPS game where a player plays against the computer through the use of the computer camera. 

## Milestone 2

In milestone 2 the task was to create a computer vision system (also known as a model) - that detects whether the player is showing rock, paper or scissors to the camera. To do this:
- Teachable Machine was used to have 4 options: Rock, Paper, Scissors and Nothing and the model was trained to recognise whenever these 4 options were chosen by the user. 
- The more images that were taken the better the model so I iteratively trained the model till I was satisfied that it would recognise each of the 4 options with 100% accuracy.
- The model will be used to ensure that the player input through the camera will be recognised without issues so that the player can play against the randomly chosen option by the computer.
- There was no code for this section of the project.

## Milestone 2

- Does what you have built in this milestone connect to the previous one? If so explain how. What technologies are used? Why have you used them? Have you run any commands in the terminal? If so insert them using backticks (To get syntax highlighting for code snippets add the language after the first backticks).

- Example below:

```bash
/bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --zookeeper 127.0.0.1:2181
```

- The above command is used to check whether the topic has been created successfully, once confirmed the API script is edited to send data to the created kafka topic. The docker container has an attached volume which allows editing of files to persist on the container. The result of this is below:

```python
"""Insert your code here"""
```

> Insert screenshot of what you have built working.

## Milestone n

- Continue this process for every milestone, making sure to display clear understanding of each task and the concepts behind them as well as understanding of the technologies used.

- Also don't forget to include code snippets and screenshots of the system you are building, it gives proof as well as it being an easy way to evidence your experience!

## Conclusions

- Maybe write a conclusion to the project, what you understood about it and also how you would improve it or take it further.

- Read through your documentation, do you understand everything you've written? Is everything clear and cohesive?
